# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Response Conciseness Guidelines

**Core Principle**: Keep non-code responses concise and focused on actionable information, push changes directly to main branch.

**Response Length Rules**:
- Maximum 3-4 paragraphs for non-code responses
- Code examples, diffs, and technical output are exempt from length limits
- Focus on key findings with clear next steps

**Avoid Verbosity Patterns**:
- Repetitive context or background information
- Phrases like "as I mentioned", "previously", "to recap"
- Multiple paragraphs when bullet points would be more effective
- Describing what you'll do instead of just doing it
- Unnecessary explanations when direct answers suffice

**Preferred Format**:
- Lead with actionable information and new insights
- Use bullet points for lists instead of prose
- Combine related points into fewer paragraphs
- Focus on "what" and "next steps" rather than lengthy "why" explanations

## Important VM Setup info
All the 4 VMs in this setup are part of AWS CDK stack, called smartnics_stack. The CDK code lives in `infra/` in this repo (mirrored from `C:\Users\shir\Documents\GitHub\private-core-cdk-stack`, excluding the gitlab runner stack).

## Project Overview

This is a proof-of-concept demonstrating **0-RTT TCP** - a technique to eliminate the traditional 3-way handshake latency by using intelligent middleware that spoofs server responses. This allows clients to send application data immediately without waiting for the full handshake to complete, saving approximately 50-200ms (1-RTT) per connection.

**IMPORTANT**: This is an educational/demonstration project only. Not suitable for production use.

## Architecture

The system consists of 4 VMs connected in series:

```
Client VM → ClientNIC VM → ServerNIC VM → Server VM
```

### Component Responsibilities

1. **Client VM** (`client-app/`): Standard unmodified TCP client application
2. **ClientNIC VM** (`clientnic/`): **Core 0-RTT logic** - intercepts SYN packets, sends spoofed SYN-ACK, manages sequence number translation
3. **ServerNIC VM** (`servernic/`): Simple transparent packet forwarder between ClientNIC and Server
4. **Server VM** (`server-app/`): Standard unmodified TCP server application

### Key Technical Concepts

#### Sequence Number Translation
The ClientNIC maintains a **flow table** tracking each connection's sequence number delta:
- When SYN arrives from client → immediately send spoofed SYN-ACK with random ISN (spoofed_server_isn)
- Forward original SYN to server → receive real SYN-ACK → record real ISN (real_server_isn)
- Calculate delta: `seq_delta = spoofed_server_isn - real_server_isn`
- All client→server packets: rewrite ACK by subtracting delta
- All server→client packets: rewrite SEQ by adding delta

#### Flow Processing Pipeline

**ClientNIC handles packets in two directions:**

From Client (eth0):
1. SYN → send spoofed SYN-ACK + forward to ServerNIC
2. ACK/DATA → buffer until delta known, then rewrite SEQ and forward

From ServerNIC (eth1):
1. Real SYN-ACK → drop (already sent spoofed one), record real ISN, calculate delta
2. DATA → rewrite ACK and forward to client

**ServerNIC is stateless:**
- eth1 (from ClientNIC) → forward to eth2 (to Server)
- eth2 (from Server) → forward to eth1 (to ClientNIC)

#### Packet Modification
After rewriting sequence/acknowledgment numbers, **checksums must be recalculated**:
```python
del packet[IP].chksum
del packet[TCP].chksum
# Scapy auto-recalculates on send
```

## Technology Stack

- **Python 3.8+**: All components written in Python
- **Scapy**: Packet manipulation library (wraps AF_PACKET raw sockets)
- **Linux**: Required for raw socket support and virtual networking
- **Network setup**: VMs connected via virtual networks (bridge/veth)

### Scapy Essentials

Scapy provides:
- **Packet construction**: Layer-by-layer with `/` operator: `IP(dst="10.0.0.1")/TCP(flags="S")`
- **Sniffing**: `sniff(iface="eth0", prn=handler, filter="tcp")`
- **Sending**: `sendp(packet, iface="eth0")` (Layer 2) or `send(packet)` (Layer 3)
- **Modification**: Access fields like `packet[TCP].seq`, delete checksums to force recalc

## Development Status

- [x] ServerNIC stateless forwarder (`servernic/app-without-translate/main.py`)
- [x] Client TCP application (`client-app/client.py`)
- [x] Server TCP application (`server-app/server.py`)
- [x] ClientNIC 0-RTT logic (`clientnic/`)
- [x] Integration test suite (`expermients/`)

## Development Workflow

All components are implemented. Current focus is integration testing and bug fixes:

1. Run `./expermients/zero-rtt-clientnic-translate/run_experiment.sh` to execute the full test suite
2. Investigate failures using the manual steps in `.claude/skills/zero-rtt-integration-tester/SKILL.md`
3. File findings in `expermients/zero-rtt-clientnic-translate/reports/`

## Testing Approach

### Unit Testing
- Flow table operations (create, update, lookup)
- Sequence number rewriting algorithms
- Checksum recalculation correctness

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end connection establishment
- Data transmission correctness
- Multiple concurrent connections
- Connection teardown (FIN/RST)

### Performance Testing
- Measure time-to-first-byte with/without 0-RTT
- Expected improvement: 1-RTT reduction (50-200ms depending on network latency)
- Test with simulated high-latency networks

## Important Constraints

### Protocol Limitations
- **TCP only** (not UDP, QUIC, etc.)
- Does not handle TCP options (timestamps, window scaling, SACK)
- Assumes reliable network (no packet reordering)

### Security Warnings
- **Educational/demo use only** - not production-ready
- No encryption or authentication
- Vulnerable to packet injection in real networks
- Should only be used in isolated/controlled environments

### Implementation Notes
- Flow identification uses 4-tuple: (src_ip, src_port, dst_ip, dst_port)
- All sequence number arithmetic must use 32-bit wraparound: `& 0xFFFFFFFF`
- Client and server applications remain **completely unmodified** - transparency is key
- Packet buffering required: client may send data before real SYN-ACK arrives
